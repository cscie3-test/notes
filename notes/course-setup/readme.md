## CSCI E31 Weeks 1 and 2: Getting your Node environment set up
Work through the pages above in order to get your environment set up for this course. This will include:

+ NodeJS
+ Windows CMDER command line tools (custom version from Prof. Susan Buck)
+ Mac XCode command line tools
+ git
+ github
+ Digital Ocean (DO)
+ the ability to move and deploy code from your local environment to github and DO

If you are unable to complete any of these steps, you must reach out to get help.
Use the course Piazza forum (linked in Canvas) and/or attend a section meeting and/or
ask any of the teaching staff for help. (Piazza is the best way to reach teaching staff with
course content questions.)

**You will be unable to complete the course assignments if you don't successfully
complete the steps outlined on these pages, so don't wait until the last minute and
don't consider yourself done until you're able to move code to github and Digital Ocean
and execute Node code on DO.**
